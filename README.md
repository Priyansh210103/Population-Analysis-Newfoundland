# Population Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This Power BI project provides an in-depth analysis of Newfoundland and Labrador's population trends, utilizing official Canadian government data. The dashboard highlights historical and projected population growth under various scenarios. It demonstrates my expertise in **Power BI**, **data analysis**, and **DAX**. As part of my work at the **Regional Analytics Lab (RAnLab)** in Newfoundland, this analysis directly supports regional decision-making and community initiatives.

## Data Source
The data is sourced from:
- **Statistics Canada**: National and provincial population projections (2023–2048).
- **Newfoundland and Labrador Provincial Government**: Regional population trends and projection scenarios.

These datasets ensure credibility and provide insights into low growth, medium growth, high growth, and aging scenarios.

## Features
- **Dynamic Visualizations**:
  - Historical and Projected Population Growth (2000–2030).
  - Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth Rate Analysis.
  - Population Change Across Quarters.
  - 3-Year Moving Average Population Trends.
  - Correlation Between Population and Growth Rates.
- **Scenario Projections**:
  - Low Growth, Medium Growth (M1–M6), High Growth, Slow Aging, and Fast Aging scenarios.
  - Dynamic filtering through slicers for interactive exploration.

## Skills Demonstrated
### 1. **Power BI Expertise**
- Transformed raw government datasets into actionable insights.
- Designed interactive dashboards with visually appealing charts and slicers.
- Applied a consistent theme for intuitive user navigation.

### 2. **DAX Proficiency**
- Created dynamic measures to calculate:
  - YoY Growth Rate (%).
  - Projected Population for 2030.
  - 3-Year Moving Average for smoothing irregularities.
  - Latest Population dynamically based on the dataset.

### 3. **Advanced Analysis**
- Incorporated trend analysis to uncover long-term patterns.
- Used correlation visualizations to link growth rates with population size.
- Analyzed scenarios for future decision-making.

### 4. **Real-World Impact**
This project reflects my contribution to RAnLab, where I assist policymakers and businesses in accessing actionable regional data. The insights help with urban planning, economic strategies, and resource allocation in Newfoundland and Labrador.

## Dashboard Highlights
- **Current and Projected Population**: Snapshots of the latest population and projections for 2030.
- **Population Growth Trends**: A line chart for historical and future projections.
- **YoY Growth Analysis**: A combined bar and line chart highlighting annual trends.
- **Quarterly Population Changes**: Detailed analysis of population variation across quarters.
- **Correlation Insights**: Scatter plot visualizing the relationship between growth rate and population.
- **Scenario-Based Insights**: Dashboard slicers allow users to switch between growth scenarios.

## How I Built It
### Key Steps
1. **Data Transformation**:
   - Cleaned and structured raw data using Power Query.
   - Handled errors, removed nulls, and formatted data for Power BI.
   - Ensured proper data types for numeric and time-based calculations.

2. **Measure Creation**:
   - Used DAX to create dynamic measures for projections, growth rates, and averages.
   - Designed measures to adapt to slicer selections for interactive filtering.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Implemented diverse charts (line, area, scatter) for comprehensive analysis.
   - Organized visual elements for clarity and ease of use.

4. **Scenario Analysis**:
   - Integrated multiple growth scenarios from official projections.
   - Enabled comparison between low, medium, high growth, and aging scenarios.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository and download the Power BI `.pbix` file.
2. Open the file in Power BI Desktop.
3. Use the slicers to explore data by year, quarter, and projection scenarios.
4. Interact with the dashboard to uncover insights about Newfoundland and Labrador's population.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Build comprehensive dashboards in Power BI.
- Create advanced DAX measures for dynamic and complex analyses.
- Support real-world decision-making with credible insights.
- Translate raw data into interactive visual narratives.
